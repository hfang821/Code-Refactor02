# Code Refactor Starter 

## Description:

1. This website is designed to help out clients to understand the use and benefits of three valuable digital marketing tools: Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Online Reputaiton Management and Social Media Marketing.  
2. This project was completed based on the basic HTML & CSS concepts, producing an intuitive, accessible demonstration of the technologies provided by "Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.".
3. By viewing the content, our clients can easily select the service of their choice.
4. During the process of improving the website, I have learned the tools & skills necessary to design a website that is clear, accessible, and learned how to troubleshoot the mysterious mistakes using Chrome's DevTools, as well as following the appropriate semantic element structure of the HTML elements, and including comments for each element/section of the page.
